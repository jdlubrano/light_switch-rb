      switch:
        confirm:
          delete: >
            Are you sure that you want to delete %{name}?


            If your code still references this switch, it will behave as if it is turned on.

          turn_off: Are you sure that you want to turn off this switch?
          turn_on: Are you sure that you want to turn on this switch?
